    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
  <p>The moment I enrolled in the Computer Science program, I set two complementary goals: to build solutions that matter and to understand the full lifecycle of modern software, from the data structures at its core to the user experiences that make it meaningful. Curating this capstone ePortfolio has allowed me to take four years of classroom learning, personal experimentation, and team projects and distill them into a cohesive narrative of growth, competence, and professional readiness.</p>

  <h3>Translating Coursework Into Career-Ready Strengths</h3>
  <p>Throughout the program, every major course became an opportunity to deepen a distinct facet of my skill set. Data Structures and Algorithms challenged me to optimize beyond “working code,” pushing runtime from O(n²) to O(n log n) while optimizing for the fastest possible retrieval when organizing courses. Software Security taught me to see threats early by habitually integrating static analysis and dependency checks into my CI pipelines. Meanwhile, Current and Emerging Trends honed my ability to scan technical horizons, which later informed my decision to containerize the capstone into microservices rather than iterating on a single-tier monolith.</p>

  <p>Building the ePortfolio required me to synthesize those disparate experiences into artifacts that demonstrate quantifiable impact—for instance, converting a basic Java data model into a Node/Express service that now answers API calls in under 25 ms on average or architecting a MERN-stack CRUD app that maintains 100% passing integration tests in GitHub Actions. Each artifact is therefore both a deliverable and empirical evidence of my ability to move projects from idea to deployment.</p>

  <h3>Team Collaboration and Stakeholder Communication</h3>
  <p>Effective teamwork and communication have been central to my development as a software engineer. A pivotal example of this was during the SNHU Travel project in CS250: Software Development Lifecycle, where we used the Scrum-agile framework to deliver a web application in iterative sprints. Our team included a Product Owner, Scrum Master, developers, and testers—each with distinct responsibilities that contributed to our collective success.</p>

  <p>As a developer on the project, I helped transform evolving user stories into functional software while adapting to stakeholder feedback. For example, one of our top priorities involved revamping the display of travel destinations into a slideshow format based on customer input. This change occurred mid-development, but because of our agile workflow—especially sprint reviews and backlog refinement—we were able to integrate the feedback late in the cycle without losing momentum.</p>

  <p>Our Scrum Master facilitated daily stand-up meetings that kept us aligned and quickly uncovered any roadblocks. Meanwhile, testers created detailed test cases to verify system behavior, including step-by-step validation of filter options on the SNHU Travel platform. The continual communication among roles, bolstered by backlog grooming and sprint reviews, ensured we delivered high-quality, user-centered outcomes.</p>

  <p>Beyond this project, my capstone reinforced these collaborative principles in a more technical context. I acted as both developer and architect, presenting a live demonstration of my microservices design and fielding questions about security, scalability, and endpoint functionality from faculty reviewers. These experiences refined my ability to communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders and emphasized the importance of transparency, feedback loops, and collaborative iteration in real-world software development.</p>

  <h3>Technical Foundations: From Algorithms to Security</h3>
  <p>• Data Structures & Algorithms: I routinely balance theoretical rigor with pragmatic performance. In the Algorithms artifact you will see a custom Trie, Min-Heap, and a tail-optimized Merge Sort powering high-volume search and scheduling functions.</p>
  <p>• Software Engineering & Database Design: My microservices artifact reveals a Docker-orchestrated, domain-driven architecture. Each service owns its schema, is versioned with Flyway, and exposes an OpenAPI-documented REST interface.</p>
  <p>• Security: Across artifacts I implement JWT-based authentication, enforce least-privilege RBAC, and integrate dependency-scanning into CI.</p>
  <p>These competencies ensure I can join a codebase at any depth—optimizing an algorithm one day, re-sharding a Mongo cluster the next, or tightening a security header before release.</p>

  <h3>How the Artifacts Fit Together</h3>
  <p>The three enhanced artifacts function as a layered showcase of my breadth:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design Enhancement</strong> – demonstrates architectural thinking: decomposing a monolith into secure, containerized services with automated CI/CD.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement</strong> – proves algorithmic fluency: implementing performant custom structures that drive real-time features.</li>
    <li><strong>Databases Enhancement</strong> – highlights full-stack capability: building a responsive React interface tightly coupled with a well-modeled MongoDB backend.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, they mirror a production ecosystem: a data-intensive backend, orchestrated services, and a user-facing front-end—all secured and rigor-tested.</p>

  <h3>Professional Goals and Values</h3>
  <p>Looking ahead, I aim to join a forward-thinking engineering team where I can own end-to-end features and mentor junior developers in clean-code and DevSecOps practices. My guiding values—accessibility, reliability, and continual learning—were shaped by coursework that emphasized ethical computing. The ePortfolio’s transparent documentation and 100% open-source code reflect that ethos: software should be understandable, testable, and improvable by the community.</p>

  <p>In sum, this portfolio is more than a graduation requirement—it is a living résumé of delivered software, measured results, and professional maturity. I invite you to explore each artifact, watch the accompanying code review, and see how the pieces interlock to form a well-rounded, security-minded, and performance-oriented software engineer ready to contribute from day one.</p>

      <h3>Original Artifacts</h3>

      <a href="https://github.com/EnjeeBee/Rescue-Animals-Original-Artifact" target="_blank">
        View Original Artifact 1 – Rescue Animals (Java)
      </a>
      <p>
        This artifact began as a simple Java class called <code>RescueAnimal.java</code> that was designed to
        store and manage data related to rescue animals. It encapsulated properties like name, type, gender,
        acquisition date, and training status using object-oriented principles. The class supported basic getter/setter
        methods but did not include any complex logic or persistent storage. It served as a foundation for demonstrating
        inheritance and encapsulation in Java.
      </p>

      <a href="https://github.com/EnjeeBee/Software-Test-Automations-QA" target="_blank">
        View Original Artifact 2 – Software Test Automation
      </a>
      <p>
        This artifact represents a basic test automation framework developed in Java. It consists of unit test scripts
        written using JUnit to verify the behavior of a software application. The project includes examples of
        assertion-based testing, test case grouping, and edge-case validation. Its purpose was to introduce automated
        quality assurance practices during the software testing course.

      <h3>Enhanced Artifacts</h3>

      <a href="https://github.com/EnjeeBee/Software-Engineering-and-Design-Enhancement" target="_blank">
        View Enhanced Artifact 1 – Software Engineering & Design
      </a>
      <p>
        This enhancement transformed the original monolithic Java class into a containerized microservices architecture.
        The application was broken into modular services—appointment, contact, and task—each with its own data model
        and API layer. Docker Compose was used to orchestrate these services, while each exposed secure endpoints via
        REST. The system was designed for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns, demonstrating
        advanced software engineering principles.
      </p>

      <a href="https://github.com/EnjeeBee/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Enhancement" target="_blank">
        View Enhanced Artifact 2 – Algorithms & Data Structures
      </a>
      <p>
        The original animal data model was restructured into a backend microservice built with Node.js and Express.
        Algorithmic enhancements included a Trie for prefix-based animal name search, a min-heap for managing
        animal assignments by training priority, and recursive merge sort for age-based sorting. These additions
        reflect optimized data access, modular code design, and efficient use of memory and processing.
      </p>

      <a href="https://github.com/EnjeeBee/Databases-Enhancement" target="_blank">
        View Enhanced Artifact 3 – Databases
      </a>
      <p>
        This enhancement built a full-stack rescue animal CRUD application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
        It features modular React components, persistent storage with Mongoose, and dynamic client-server interaction via Axios.
        Form validation, error handling, and a styled responsive UI were integrated to simulate a real-world data-driven workflow.
